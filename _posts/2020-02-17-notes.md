I've just put together some review notes on the discrete Fourier transform and filters. In part this was to correct a couple of notational inconsistencies between my lecture and the textbook. These are related to the definition of the Fourier coefficients, which disagreed from the text by a scale factor of N.

Please take a look at both the written notes, which you can find here:
<a href="https://github.com/dkrashen/signalprocessing-notes/raw/master/signals.pdf">signals.pdf</a>, and the accompanying video, which is linked to the notes, which you can find here:<a href="https://youtu.be/SmIaoE4fbgs">YouTube</a>.

See you all Thursday!
